         <p>Hello everyone!<br><br>
            I'm Ziyan Jin (and you could call me Emily or Zi Yan) from the Communication University 
            of China. My major is Advertising in undergraduate education. And I once worked as a 
            copywriter in Ogilvy & Mather and Serviceplan co., and both in Beijing.<br><br>
            As for my most favorite museum, I have to recommend the Sanying Art Museum (also called 
            Studio Ghibli) in Tokyo. There would be an exhibition room displaying the process of 
            creating animated films, with keyframing, coloring, and background painting. It's 
            wonderful.<br><br>
            Here are my top five favorite museums and galleries:
            <ol> 
                <li>Studio Ghibli</li>
                <li>Mus√©e Marmottan Monet</li>
                <li>Museum Centre Vapriikki</li>
                <li>Uffizi Gallery</li>
                <li>Suzhou Museum</li>
            </ol>
            I'm in London now and hopefully I'd have the chance to explore more museums in this city :p
