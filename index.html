        <h1>Collection: Death and memory</h1>

        <h2>Brief introduction</h2>

        <p>Through the collection with a theme of <b>Death and memory</b>, people could dicovered the
            fascinating beliefs and rituals around death and remembrance, from ghostbusting in 
            Ancient Mesopotamia with Irving Finkel to an unparalleled discovery of Anglo-Saxon 
            finery within a buried ship at Sutton Hoo.</p>

        <h2>My favourite part of the collection</h2>

        <p>When I explored the details of Anglo-Saxon ship burial at Sutton Hoo, I generate some 
            interests about the owner of the burial. So then I watched a video which called Curator's 
            Corner with Sue Brunning. It was so eye-catching. Brunning's study is about that the owner 
            was left-handed, with patterns of wear indicating it was worn on the right side and carried 
            in the left hand. <p>

        <p>The most fascinating part of the video is that Brunning extrapolates that being left-handed 
            could have provided an advantage in battle as most combatants might be anticipating a 
            right-handed attack. For me, I had a little electrical moment when I first heard about 
            this theory. That is because, <strong>her hypothesis seems simple to understand, but it's 
            very practical and quite hard to propose. It would be hard to think from this perspective 
            if you don't have any boxing experience, or more importantly, if you couldn't use your 
            imagination fantastically.</strong> </p>
            
        <p>Her theory made me believe that these objects in the burial might look like sitting 
            quietly, but they're not actually quiet objects. They're loud with information about 
            the people in the past. </p>
